Glad to launch their beautiful new Asia Pacific headquarters here this morning.

Being in Singapore, Google named the areas around their campus ‘kampungs’, to encourage the kampung (village) spirit of good neighbours and collaboration.

Having the campus here is a step in our #SmartNation journey. Tech is disruptive, and we expect to be disrupted. But with partners like Google, Singapore will come up on the right side of the disruption.

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.

In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission to do a review of the scheme.  I’m glad many people came forward to give their views. 

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

They have silicone valley and many top medicine research centers. Most of the HQ of companies moved to SG as our coporate tax is low. B is trying to copy us and do it as 20% also... I am not belittling our country but we don't have a silicon valley(maybe the place near Timbre+ JTC or NUH and all the hospitals). The government pump in alot of capital on biomedical. With the B's country lower tax as us they have a much bigger space and they are pioneers of electronic tech and to a certain extent medical expertise.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

As a minority, honestly, I welcome the reservation for minority candidates. As a majority Chinese country, the Chinese have a bigger talent pool making it easier to find Chinese candidates for President. It is definitely harder to sieve suitable minority candidates if the scope is wider. By making the scope smaller, it is easier to find suitable minority candidates. Not saying that Singapore is lacking talented minorities but if we were to compare our numbers to the majority, we would definitely be overwhelmed.

Singapore is a multi-racial country and it definitely needs representation of all races once in a while. If we were to stay as normal, it would be harder to find talented minorities as i've explained earlier due to our ratio compared to the majority.

Why don't i view this as Tokenism as some minorities have stated it to be?

Eventhough the candidates are reseved for a certain race, not any Minority are allowed to be a candidate. There are still criterias to meet, the candidates for President would definitely be capable for the duties. Instead of finding the most suitable candidates out of all Singaporeans which could mean a Chinese due to the majority of Chinese citizens, the suitable candidates will be picked from a certain race allowing a suitable candidate from that race to be eligible for nomination. It's an improved form of meritocracy to ensure minority representation.

I commend the government because they are trying to ensure that the minorities are being represented in the World Stage. As the President is usually a ceremonial role for official visits, it is important to maintain the image of our country as multi-racial and not just a Chinese state. It is about time that there would be a Malay President, it's been 46 years and i look forward to this.

In a way also, it can also loosen the racial tensions in our country. Southeast Asia is rilled up with racial differences example would be Malaysia and Indonesia who uses race and religion to split the country apart. Singaporean Malays are unhappy and it's a fact because they feel that they are not being represented enough. Minorities do have high positions but if compared to the majority, it is definitely smaller. This is due to our small population compared to the majority. Thus I believe that, this decision will ensure that all minorities are being represented and it will also loosen the tension in our Country.",Khairul Haziq (10208805766320664),44,1258599687536068_1258786117517425,2016-11-09 01:12:54,U said it well bro.

As a majority Chinese country, the Chinese have a bigger talent pool making it easier to find Chinese candidates for President. It is definitely harder to sieve suitable minority candidates if the scope is wider. By making the scope smaller, it is easier to find suitable minority candidates. Not saying that Singapore is lacking talented minorities but if we were to compare our numbers to the majority, we would definitely be overwhelmed.

Singapore is a multi-racial country and it definitely needs representation of all races once in a while. If we were to stay as normal, it would be harder to find talented minorities as i've explained earlier due to our ratio compared to the majority.

Why don't i view this as Tokenism as some minorities have stated it to be?

Eventhough the candidates are reseved for a certain race, not any Minority are allowed to be a candidate. There are still criterias to meet, the candidates for President would definitely be capable for the duties. Instead of finding the most suitable candidates out of all Singaporeans which could mean a Chinese due to the majority of Chinese citizens, the suitable candidates will be picked from a certain race allowing a suitable candidate from that race to be eligible for nomination. It's an improved form of meritocracy to ensure minority representation.

I commend the government because they are trying to ensure that the minorities are being represented in the World Stage. As the President is usually a ceremonial role for official visits, it is important to maintain the image of our country as multi-racial and not just a Chinese state. It is about time that there would be a Malay President, it's been 46 years and i look forward to this.

In a way also, it can also loosen the racial tensions in our country. Southeast Asia is rilled up with racial differences example would be Malaysia and Indonesia who uses race and religion to split the country apart. Singaporean Malays are unhappy and it's a fact because they feel that they are not being represented enough. Minorities do have high positions but if compared to the majority, it is definitely smaller. This is due to our small population compared to the majority.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.

The reason why I will spoil my vote next year is to showcase how demeaning this is to the Malay Community and I won't stand for it when my Malay friends get humiliated so thoroughly and so damagingly by the PM. Capable Malay candidates who will be voted in in a normal election would now be perceived negatively as being able to succeed in an election reserved for them. And meritocracy? Do you even know the definition? So what if the Malay candidates were to meet all the criteria? That's still not meritocracy. It's getting the most qualified candidates at a given point in time.

As a minority, honestly, I welcome the reservation for minority candidates. As a majority Chinese country, the Chinese have a bigger talent pool making it easier to find Chinese candidates for President. It is definitely harder to sieve suitable minority candidates if the scope is wider. By making the scope smaller, it is easier to find suitable minority candidates. Not saying that Singapore is lacking talented minorities but if we were to compare our numbers to the majority, we would definitely be overwhelmed.

Singapore is a multi-racial country and it definitely needs representation of all races once in a while. If we were to stay as normal, it would be harder to find talented minorities as i've explained earlier due to our ratio compared to the majority.

Why don't i view this as Tokenism as some minorities have stated it to be?

Eventhough the candidates are reseved for a certain race, not any Minority are allowed to be a candidate. There are still criterias to meet, the candidates for President would definitely be capable for the duties. Instead of finding the most suitable candidates out of all Singaporeans which could mean a Chinese due to the majority of Chinese citizens, the suitable candidates will be picked from a certain race allowing a suitable candidate from that race to be eligible for nomination. It's an improved form of meritocracy to ensure minority representation.

I commend the government because they are trying to ensure that the minorities are being represented in the World Stage. As the President is usually a ceremonial role for official visits, it is important to maintain the image of our country as multi-racial and not just a Chinese state. It is about time that there would be a Malay President, it's been 46 years and i look forward to this.

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.

If we look at the recent presidential elections, 2011, we do not have a non Chinese race contesting, 2005, 1999, it's a walkover for Nathan. The root cause of the problem seems to be either a lack of interest or failure to meet the strict criteria. Government should look into how they can do more to help the ""minority race"" do better in their careers and therefore being about to meet the criteria by their own merits. For example, a very sensitive topic, helping Malays to climb to the top of SAF. There are many things that can be done outside and beyond the presidential election which the PAP has not addressed, maybe because it's not of political importance to the PAP.

Instead, PAP goes for the constitutionalise approach, which is very typical of PAP, taking shortcuts instead of fixing the root causes. This is very insincere and I am very disappointed with the PAP.

In case you didn't notice, I am a TCB voter and our numbers are close TT voters, at 738,311 man strong or 34.84% Making such a change to disqualify TCB who have announced his intention to contest would in my opinion requires a referendum as TCB has proven to have strong support of Singaporeans to be the next president.

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

I have always been grateful for what you have done for Singapore. Our achievements would not have been possible without your leadership.
However, I have been particularly concerned about the recent discussion centred around the Elected Presidency and I m happy to know that there have been a lot of Singaporeans voicing their concerns as well.

I urge you to reconsider the following :

1) Do we have to rotate our Presidents to show we are  a multi racial society? What does it really show if our President is a Chinese, Indian, Malay or Eurasian? After all, we are all Singaporeans. We are all sons of our land and no particular race is more privileged than the other.

2) In the US, white is obviously the majority with black at 13.2% and Latinos/Hispanics at 17%. That did not stop black Obama from contesting and running 2 successful terms as the US president. 
Is the issue in Singapore due to other races  dominating the Presidential elections or is it because no able man is willing to step up and take the role? We are 76% Chinese, 15% malay and 7.5% Indian but I would believe Singaporeans would hope for a fair and open contest for all races.

3) By introducing such bespoke rules, are we really a democratic nation? It is 77-6 to approve the Bill but clearly a lot of Singaporeans  are having opinions on this. The nation has to be further consulted. The government risk alienating the citizens and distance itself further from the new millenium generation.

4) By making it mandatory for the President to rotate, inevitably it throws into question what is the essence of meritocracy in this nation. It also start opening a can of worms on how some of the important strategic positions like Prime Minister, Finance Minister or statutory boards need to have this requirement as well. 

Thank you for listening!",Gary Ho (10155372365822388),0
