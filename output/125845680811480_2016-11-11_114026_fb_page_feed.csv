Here is some advice to all...
To the Liberals... take a breath. The world is still spinning. 8 years ago, you asked everyone to accept the election results, support the newly elected President and give him a chance to succeed. Time to follow your own advice. and PLEASE STOP LISTENING TO THE MEDIA HYPE! Judge with your own eyes and ears on what he says and does now.
To the conservatives... Don't blow this by being the asses people think you are. Don't try and undo everything.. instead, make them better. Remember how the last 8 years felt when your ideas were not listened to, when policies were jammed down your throat and DON'T REPEAT THAT MISTAKE!!! Listen to ideas, work with your counterparts across the aisle. Make no mistake, this election result was because the people are tired of business as usual.. If you repeat this mistake, it will be a sure fire way to lose in the next election.
To the Celebrities who vowed ton leave if Trump won.. Please pack your bags and go! By making such  a pledge you have shown that youM love making false threats to push your agenda more than working to make your country better. Buh-Bye!",Mabasa Nhekairo (1470085343020338),4

I'm no genius. Don't get me wrong I respect Singapore's founding family for maintaining control for so long and still managing to have the facade of democracy. It is thier relentless grip of control that has allowed such a small country with so few resources and facing great difficulties to become a significant place that is peaceful with a good quality of life. But you may want to look up examples of other countries that have maintained power in one family for more than half a Centuary and see how they dealt with opposition parties.,John Sexton (10154237751269542),0
