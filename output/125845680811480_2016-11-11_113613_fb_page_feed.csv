The President is the most important unifying symbol of our multi-racial nation. He must represent all Singaporeans, and every citizen must be able to identify with him.

In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission to do a review of the scheme.  I’m glad many people came forward to give their views. 

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.
