I am sick of having to walk across streets from my house just to flag a taxi. With Uber/Grab, they solved my problem by waiting for me at the lifts area and best part is there isn't a booking fee. If Uber doesn't charge a booking fee, why should I call and book a taxi.

The Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP Singapore) has played a valuable role in the Malay/Muslim community since their formation in 1991. Aside from their education, youth and social assistance programmes, AMP has also invested in innovative projects such as Common Space – an incubator to groom start ups from the community.

I was happy to attend AMP’s 25th anniversary dinner last night. I hope AMP carries on working closely with MENDAKI Singapore and other Malay/Muslim organisations, so that the community can continue to shine in our multi-racial Singapore. – LHL

Dalam masyarakat berbilang kaum, matlamatnya adalah semua akan maju bersama. Tiada yang ketinggalan. 

Sejak pembentukannya pada 1991, AMP telah memainkan peranan penting dalam membantu masyarakat Melayu/Islam bergerak maju bersama kaum-kaum lain di Singapura. Selain daripada program pendidikan dan bantuan sosial, AMP juga melabur dalam projek inovatif seperti project ""Common Space” – inkubator untuk melahirkan lebih banyak firma teknolgi atau start-up dari masyarakat Melayu/Islam. 

Saya gembira dapat bersama-sama meraikan Jubli Perak AMP malam tadi. Saya harap AMP akan terus gigih bekerja rapat dengan badan-badan lain seperti Mendaki agar masyarakat Melayu/Islam terus mekar bersinar dalam masyarakat majmuk Singapura. – LHL",111,1952,59,1260302964032407_1260414977354539,2016-11-10 13:54:30,,Guns Roses (119598885187148),0
