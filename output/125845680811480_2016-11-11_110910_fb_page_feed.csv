I am sick of having to pay extra charges for using credit card when I take taxi. The worst part is some taxi don't even accept credit cards or simply say that the machine is spoilt. Uber/Grab solved that problem for me.
I am sick of having to walk across streets from my house just to flag a taxi. With Uber/Grab, they solved my problem by waiting for me at the lifts area and best part is there isn't a booking fee. If Uber doesn't charge a booking fee, why should I call and book a taxi.

Here is some advice to all...
To the Liberals... take a breath. The world is still spinning. 8 years ago, you asked everyone to accept the election results, support the newly elected President and give him a chance to succeed. Time to follow your own advice. and PLEASE STOP LISTENING TO THE MEDIA HYPE! Judge with your own eyes and ears on what he says and does now.
To the conservatives... Don't blow this by being the asses people think you are. Don't try and undo everything.. instead, make them better. Remember how the last 8 years felt when your ideas were not listened to, when policies were jammed down your throat and DON'T REPEAT THAT MISTAKE!!! Listen to ideas, work with your counterparts across the aisle. Make no mistake, this election result was because the people are tired of business as usual.. If you repeat this mistake, it will be a sure fire way to lose in the next election.
To the Celebrities who vowed ton leave if Trump won.. Please pack your bags and go! By making such  a pledge you have shown that youM love making false threats to push your agenda more than working to make your country better. Buh-Bye!",Mabasa Nhekairo (1470085343020338),4

However, I am not like Trump in so many ways but do not feel demeaned by him. 

He is our duly elected President- Elect after winning against so many odds.

While I do not agree with him in some areas (as I do not with Obama) I trust the American people and our system of checks and balances.

I'm no genius. Don't get me wrong I respect Singapore's founding family for maintaining control for so long and still managing to have the facade of democracy. It is thier relentless grip of control that has allowed such a small country with so few resources and facing great difficulties to become a significant place that is peaceful with a good quality of life.

In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission to do a review of the scheme.  I’m glad many people came forward to give their views. 

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.

I am not belittling our country but we don't have a silicon valley(maybe the place near Timbre+ JTC or NUH and all the hospitals). The government pump in alot of capital on biomedical. With the B's country lower tax as us they have a much bigger space and they are pioneers of electronic tech and to a certain extent medical expertise.

You need guts to run a country, do you have guts, no you didn't, maybe you will. That is why I didn't even see you around previously as anything more than a 'nick'. This is a taunt or challenge if you prefer, if you have what it takes, start running now. (Y) We have been eagerly awaiting you and figuring out why did all the opposition disappear over all the past twelve months.

People's Action Party doesn't recruit people last minute, before Chan Chun Sing joined PAP we already knew what He was good at since e.g. when I was 18 years old as well as His limitations. By now I am hitting 35, I know Chan for 17 years, I will still vote Him if I am in Bouna Vista, what do I know about you then? Nothing. Do you personally have so much hope in 'nothing' and faith in an empty wallet that you will be an NMP for us without salary? If so, please carry on, I am quite keen to hear your political views.

As a minority, honestly, I welcome the reservation for minority candidates. As a majority Chinese country, the Chinese have a bigger talent pool making it easier to find Chinese candidates for President. It is definitely harder to sieve suitable minority candidates if the scope is wider. By making the scope smaller, it is easier to find suitable minority candidates. Not saying that Singapore is lacking talented minorities but if we were to compare our numbers to the majority, we would definitely be overwhelmed.

Singapore is a multi-racial country and it definitely needs representation of all races once in a while. If we were to stay as normal, it would be harder to find talented minorities as i've explained earlier due to our ratio compared to the majority.

Why don't i view this as Tokenism as some minorities have stated it to be?

Eventhough the candidates are reseved for a certain race, not any Minority are allowed to be a candidate. There are still criterias to meet, the candidates for President would definitely be capable for the duties. Instead of finding the most suitable candidates out of all Singaporeans which could mean a Chinese due to the majority of Chinese citizens, the suitable candidates will be picked from a certain race allowing a suitable candidate from that race to be eligible for nomination. It's an improved form of meritocracy to ensure minority representation.

I commend the government because they are trying to ensure that the minorities are being represented in the World Stage. As the President is usually a ceremonial role for official visits, it is important to maintain the image of our country as multi-racial and not just a Chinese state. It is about time that there would be a Malay President, it's been 46 years and i look forward to this.

In a way also, it can also loosen the racial tensions in our country. Southeast Asia is rilled up with racial differences example would be Malaysia and Indonesia who uses race and religion to split the country apart. Singaporean Malays are unhappy and it's a fact because they feel that they are not being represented enough. Minorities do have high positions but if compared to the majority, it is definitely smaller. This is due to our small population compared to the majority.

The reason why I will spoil my vote next year is to showcase how demeaning this is to the Malay Community and I won't stand for it when my Malay friends get humiliated so thoroughly and so damagingly by the PM. Capable Malay candidates who will be voted in in a normal election would now be perceived negatively as being able to succeed in an election reserved for them. And meritocracy? Do you even know the definition? So what if the Malay candidates were to meet all the criteria? That's still not meritocracy. It's getting the most qualified candidates at a given point in time.

As a minority, honestly, I welcome the reservation for minority candidates. As a majority Chinese country, the Chinese have a bigger talent pool making it easier to find Chinese candidates for President. It is definitely harder to sieve suitable minority candidates if the scope is wider. By making the scope smaller, it is easier to find suitable minority candidates. Not saying that Singapore is lacking talented minorities but if we were to compare our numbers to the majority, we would definitely be overwhelmed.

Singapore is a multi-racial country and it definitely needs representation of all races once in a while. If we were to stay as normal, it would be harder to find talented minorities as i've explained earlier due to our ratio compared to the majority.

Why don't i view this as Tokenism as some minorities have stated it to be?

Eventhough the candidates are reseved for a certain race, not any Minority are allowed to be a candidate. There are still criterias to meet, the candidates for President would definitely be capable for the duties. Instead of finding the most suitable candidates out of all Singaporeans which could mean a Chinese due to the majority of Chinese citizens, the suitable candidates will be picked from a certain race allowing a suitable candidate from that race to be eligible for nomination. It's an improved form of meritocracy to ensure minority representation.

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.

If we look at the recent presidential elections, 2011, we do not have a non Chinese race contesting, 2005, 1999, it's a walkover for Nathan. The root cause of the problem seems to be either a lack of interest or failure to meet the strict criteria. Government should look into how they can do more to help the ""minority race"" do better in their careers and therefore being about to meet the criteria by their own merits. For example, a very sensitive topic, helping Malays to climb to the top of SAF. There are many things that can be done outside and beyond the presidential election which the PAP has not addressed, maybe because it's not of political importance to the PAP.

Instead, PAP goes for the constitutionalise approach, which is very typical of PAP, taking shortcuts instead of fixing the root causes. This is very insincere and I am very disappointed with the PAP.

In case you didn't notice, I am a TCB voter and our numbers are close TT voters, at 738,311 man strong or 34.84% Making such a change to disqualify TCB who have announced his intention to contest would in my opinion requires a referendum as TCB has proven to have strong support of Singaporeans to be the next president.

I have always been grateful for what you have done for Singapore. Our achievements would not have been possible without your leadership.
However, I have been particularly concerned about the recent discussion centred around the Elected Presidency and I m happy to know that there have been a lot of Singaporeans voicing their concerns as well.

I urge you to reconsider the following :

1) Do we have to rotate our Presidents to show we are  a multi racial society? What does it really show if our President is a Chinese, Indian, Malay or Eurasian? After all, we are all Singaporeans. We are all sons of our land and no particular race is more privileged than the other.

2) In the US, white is obviously the majority with black at 13.2% and Latinos/Hispanics at 17%. That did not stop black Obama from contesting and running 2 successful terms as the US president. 
Is the issue in Singapore due to other races  dominating the Presidential elections or is it because no able man is willing to step up and take the role? We are 76% Chinese, 15% malay and 7.5% Indian but I would believe Singaporeans would hope for a fair and open contest for all races.

3) By introducing such bespoke rules, are we really a democratic nation? It is 77-6 to approve the Bill but clearly a lot of Singaporeans  are having opinions on this. The nation has to be further consulted. The government risk alienating the citizens and distance itself further from the new millenium generation.

4) By making it mandatory for the President to rotate, inevitably it throws into question what is the essence of meritocracy in this nation. It also start opening a can of worms on how some of the important strategic positions like Prime Minister, Finance Minister or statutory boards need to have this requirement as well.

Another alternative is to have a 2-race elimination method, each term of presidency cannot be the same race as presidents of previous 2 terms. So by this method, no chinese and no indian can be singapore's next, 8th president, 8th presidential race will be open for malays and eurasians (because previously we already have president nathan and president tony tan), then when it comes to 9th presidential election, it will be open for indian candidates again but closed for chinese (because dr tony tan has been the 7th president) and also closed for whichever race that's been elected to be the 8th singapore president.

In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission to do a review of the scheme.  I’m glad many people came forward to give their views. 

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election.
